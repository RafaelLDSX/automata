# Core for automata simulations

This is for studying purpose only, and it's most likely to be considered garbage, so please take it easy on me.
I'm still getting used to use git effectively, produce libs and good implementations, but I'm trying my best. You should use this carefuly, once I don't guarantee no memory leaks or excessive use of CPU.

## TODO: 
1. Separate functions to manipulate automata in a diferent file;
2. Separate simulations per file;
3. Handle memory leaks;
4. Try to figure out a way to consume less CPU, or use effectively.
